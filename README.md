# Quote Me

Quote Me is a pretty basic *quote generating app* 📝 made using Flutter as front end and Local Storage as a backend if you want Firebase or any other could be implemented. Quote Me's original mission is to let the user view four categories such as: Love, Life, Happiness, and Random; I also offered a feature for the user to add their own quote in a previous version but unfortunately I chose to discontinue this project and just keep the current state.

## Features

- Private and Secure 🔐
